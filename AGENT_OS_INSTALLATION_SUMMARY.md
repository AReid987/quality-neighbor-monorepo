## ✅ Agent OS Successfully Installed

I've analyzed your hyperlocal community platform codebase and set up Agent OS with documentation that reflects your actual implementation.

### What I Found

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, pnpm, Turborepo
- **Completed Features**: The monorepo is set up, and the `qn-dashboard` application is fully migrated and working.
- **Code Style**: The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code consistency and formatting.
- **Current Phase**: The project is in the early stages of development, with the core infrastructure in place and ready for feature development.

### What Was Created
