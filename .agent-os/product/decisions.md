## 2025-09-16: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

The initial product will be a hyperlocal community platform named Quality Neighbor, focusing on providing a trusted and curated content experience for residents and a highly targeted advertising channel for local businesses. The MVP will focus on core features including a resident-facing landing page, a monthly newsletter, a service/tool/skill exchange, and basic user and business profiles.

### Context

The decision to build Quality Neighbor is based on the identified market gap for a positive, trusted hyperlocal platform. Existing platforms like Nextdoor and Facebook Groups suffer from negativity, misinformation, and ineffective advertising models. Quality Neighbor aims to address these pain points by fostering a sense of community and providing tangible value to both residents and local businesses.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Focusing solely on a newsletter:**
   - Pros: Lower initial development cost.
   - Cons: Limited engagement and monetization potential. Does not address the need for service exchange.

2. **Building a traditional social media platform:**
   - Pros: Familiar user experience.
   - Cons: High risk of replicating the same negativity and noise as existing platforms. Difficult to differentiate.

### Rationale

The chosen hybrid approach of a content-first platform (newsletter) combined with a service exchange marketplace provides multiple value propositions and revenue streams. It allows for a lean initial launch while building a foundation for a more feature-rich platform in the future.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Creates a strong brand identity centered around trust and quality.
- Diversified engagement and monetization opportunities.
- High potential for strong community buy-in.

**Negative:**
- Requires a more complex initial build than a simple newsletter.
- Success is dependent on building a critical mass of both residents and businesses.
