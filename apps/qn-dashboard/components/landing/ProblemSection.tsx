          You're looking for a good local plumber, not another political rant. You want to know about 
          the weekend farmers market, but all you see are complaints. The endless negativity is exhausting. 
          It makes you feel less connected to your neighbors, not more. You miss out on the best parts of 
          your community because they're buried in noise.
