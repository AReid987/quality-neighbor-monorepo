# Quality Neighbor: Ideation 1 -> Deepseek | Turn 3

## Deepseek


### Thinking


We are going to provide the user with:

1. Editable Figma files for wireframes

2. Trello template for the backlog (since they prefer Trello over Asana)

However, note that as an AI, I cannot directly generate or host files. But I can guide the user on how to create these resources and provide templates in text format that they can import.

### For Figma Wireframes:

I'll describe the key screens and components in detail so the user can recreate them in Figma. Alternatively, I can provide a link to a Figma community template (if available) but since I don't have live access, I'll describe step-by-step.

### For Trello Template:

I'll provide a CSV format that can be imported into Trello, structured according to the backlog we defined.

### Step 1: Figma Wireframes Setup Guide

**Figma File Structure:**

- Create a new Figma file.

- Set up a frame for mobile (375x812) - iPhone 13 mini.

**Screens to Design:**

1. **Onboarding Flow:**

- Screen 1: Welcome screen with logo, tagline, and "Get Started" button.

- Screen 2: Signup form (3 fields: Full Name, Email, Password) and "Continue" button.

- Screen 3: Interest selection (tags like Gardening, Childcare, DIY, etc.) with "Next" button.

- Screen 4: Verification prompt (explanation and button to start ID verification via Stripe Identity).

2. **Dashboard:**

- Top: Greeting and neighborhood name.

- Middle: "Time Bank" balance (if implemented) and quick actions (e.g., "Borrow a tool", "Offer help").

- Bottom: Navigation bar (Home, Messages, Notifications, Profile).

3. **Time Bank Feature:**

- Screen: Shows a list of services offered by neighbors (with verification badges) and a search bar.

- Each card: User's name, service offered, distance, and a "Request" button.

4. **Business Profile (for Local Heroes):**

- Screen: Business name, category, verification badge, photos, description, contact button (for premium users).

**Design System:**

- **Colors:** Primary #3A86FF (for buttons), Secondary #FFBE0B (for highlights), Background #F8F9FA.

- **Typography:**

- Header: Inter Bold 40px

- Subheader: Inter SemiBold 24px

- Body: Inter Regular 16px

- **Spacing:** 8px grid (e.g., margins: 16px, padding: 24px).

**Exporting from Figma:**

- Share the Figma file with Jonny via "Share" > "Invite to edit".

### Step 2: Trello Backlog Template

**Trello Board Structure:**

- Lists:

1. Backlog

2. Sprint 1 (Week 1)

3. Sprint 2 (Week 2-3)

4. Sprint 3 (Week 4)

5. Done

**Cards (with labels for priority):**

- HIGH (red), MED (yellow), LOW (green)

**CSV Format for Import (sample):**

```csv

Name,List,Labels

"Remove 'Fax' field from signup","Sprint 1 (Week 1)","HIGH"

"Add ID verification (via Stripe Identity)","Sprint 1 (Week 1)","HIGH"

"Add Safety guidelines page","Sprint 1 (Week 1)","MED"

"Add FAQ section","Sprint 1 (Week 1)","LOW"

"Build 'Time Bank' feature (1 hr gardening = 1 credit)","Sprint 2 (Week 2-3)","HIGH"

"Tool/library map (Google Maps API + user pins)","Sprint 2 (Week 2-3)","MED"

"Activity Streak gamification","Sprint 2 (Week 2-3)","LOW"

"Local Hero biz profiles ($299/mo)","Sprint 3 (Week 4)","HIGH"

"Premium badges for users ($3/mo)","Sprint 3 (Week 4)","MED"

"Neighborhood analytics dashboard","Sprint 3 (Week 4)","LOW"

```

**How to Import:**

1. Go to Trello board > Menu > More > Print and Export > Export as CSV.

2. Replace with the above CSV content (or use import feature).

---

### Step 3: Additional Guidance

**Figma File Creation:**

- I recommend using Figma's auto-layout to maintain the 8px grid. Set up components for buttons, cards, etc.

**Trello Customization:**

- Add due dates to each card as per the sprint schedule.

- Assign cards to team members.

**Next Immediate Actions:**

1. Create the Figma wireframes using the above specs.

2. Import the Trello backlog and start Sprint 1 today.

3. Set up the manual MVP (Typeform + WhatsApp) as previously suggested.

If the user needs more detailed wireframe sketches or the CSV expanded, I can provide.
