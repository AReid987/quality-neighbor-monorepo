# Infrastructure and Deployment Overview

This section provides a high-level overview of Quality Neighbor's infrastructure setup and deployment strategy. It outlines the cloud provider, core services, and processes for delivering the application to users.

- **Cloud Provider(s):** AWS or GCP.

- **Core Services Used:** Lambda (if serverless components are adopted), S3 (for static assets), Kubernetes Engine/AWS ECS/GCP Cloud Run (for container orchestration), RDS (for managed PostgreSQL), ElastiCache (for managed Redis).

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** AWS CDK or Terraform.

    - **Location:** `infra/` directory within the project root.

- **Deployment Strategy:** CI/CD pipeline with automated promotions.

- **Tools:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.

- **Environments:** Development, Staging, Production.

- **Environment Promotion:** `dev` -> `staging` (manual approval / automated tests pass) -> `production` (automated after tests pass and optional manual approval).

- **Rollback Strategy:** Automated rollback on health check failure post-deployment, or manual trigger via CI/CD job, IaC state rollback.

## Scalability Plan

- **Microservices (Future)**: The current application design can evolve into a microservices architecture for specific domains (e.g., `Auth Service`, `Ad Management Service`, `Exchange Service`) as complexity and load increase.

- **Stateless Services**: Backend services will be designed to be stateless to facilitate horizontal scaling.

- **Database Scaling**: PostgreSQL can be scaled vertically (larger instance) initially, with options for read replicas, sharding, or cloud-managed solutions (e.g., AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL) for future horizontal scaling.

- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: For faster delivery of static assets (images, videos, CSS, JS) to users globally.

- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of backend services.

## Deployment Architecture

- **Development**: Local development environments using Docker Compose.

- **Staging**: A replica of the production environment for testing new features and releases.

- **Production**: Containerized applications deployed to Kubernetes or ECS, managed by CI/CD pipelines. Automated rollbacks will be configured for failed deployments.
