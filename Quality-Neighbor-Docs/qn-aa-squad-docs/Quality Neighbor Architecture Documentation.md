# Architecture Document for Quality Neighbor

## 1. System Overview

Quality Neighbor will be built as a modular, scalable, and secure hyperlocal platform. It will initially support core functionalities for community residents, local business owners, and an internal management team, with a strong emphasis on a positive user experience and data-driven insights. The architecture is designed for rapid development and deployment, leveraging modern cloud-native principles and a microservices-oriented approach where appropriate for future scalability.

## 2. Technology Stack

Given the ability to build a "minimal working MVP from code" in "a few hours or less", the technology stack will prioritize efficiency, developer productivity, and scalability for future growth.

- **Frontend**:

    - **Resident-facing Landing Page**: React/Next.js (for performance, SEO, and developer experience). This will integrate the pre-designed high-conversion landing page structure and visual style.

    - **Resident/Business/Internal Dashboards**: React/Next.js (for consistent UI/UX and efficient development).

    - **UI Framework/Design System**: Utilizing the 8px grid system and Radix UI-based color palette for consistent visual aesthetic and improved UX.

- **Backend**:

    - **Language/Framework**: Node.js with Express.js or Python with FastAPI/Django (for rapid API development and scalability). Choice to be confirmed based on specific team expertise for maximum velocity.

    - **Database**: PostgreSQL (for relational data, ACID compliance, and scalability) for core user, business, ad, and exchange data. Redis (for caching and real-time features like temporary message states).

    - **Authentication/Authorization**: OAuth 2.0 / JWT for token-based authentication. Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions across Resident, Business, and Internal Team roles. Implement ID verification through a dedicated service like Stripe Identity for trusted interactions.

- **Infrastructure**:

    - **Cloud Provider**: AWS or GCP (for scalability, managed services, and global reach).

    - **Containerization**: Docker for application containerization.

    - **Orchestration**: Kubernetes or AWS ECS/GCP Cloud Run (for managing containerized applications, scaling, and high availability).

    - **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI (for automated testing, building, and deployment).

    - **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus/Grafana or cloud-native solutions (CloudWatch/Stackdriver) for system health, performance, and error tracking.

- **Communication/Messaging**:

    - Real-time messaging for user-to-user and business-to-team interactions will use WebSockets.

    - Email communication (e.g., newsletter delivery, notifications) via a dedicated email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun).

**Explanation of Components:**

- **Quality Neighbor Frontend (React/Next.js)**: Serves the public-facing landing page, resident portal, business owner dashboard, and potentially the internal team dashboard. Ensures a consistent and responsive user experience.

- **Quality Neighbor Backend (Node.js/Python)**: The core API layer handling all business logic, data interactions, and integrations with external services. Designed with modularity in mind to support future microservices separation if needed.

- **PostgreSQL DB**: Stores all persistent data including user profiles, business profiles, ad campaign data, service/tool/skill listings, messages, and internal operational data.

- **Redis Cache**: Used for session management, real-time data for fast lookups, and potentially message queues.

- **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication (login, registration, password management) and token issuance. Can be a third-party service or a custom implementation leveraging existing libraries.

- **Stripe Identity API**: Integrates for robust ID verification processes, crucial for trust and safety in service exchange features.

- **Email Service Provider**: Manages transactional emails (e.g., password resets, notifications) and bulk emails (e.g., the monthly newsletter).

- **Google Maps API (Future)**: Will be integrated for features like the tool/library map.

- **Internal Team Dashboard & Agent Squad Workflow Modules**: Dedicated frontend applications or modules within a larger internal tool, providing specific interfaces for GTM, marketing, neighborhood management, and newsletter content pipeline.

- **Container Orchestration (Kubernetes/ECS)**: Manages the deployment, scaling, and operational health of the backend services.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates the build, test, and deployment process from code commit to production environment, ensuring rapid and reliable releases.

- **Monitoring & Logging**: Collects metrics and logs from all parts of the system to ensure performance, identify issues, and enable proactive management.

## 4. Data Model (High-Level)

- **User**: `userID (PK)`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `location`, `interests`, `role (Resident/Business/Internal)`, `isVerified`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

- **Business**: `businessID (PK)`, `userID (FK)`, `businessName`, `contactEmail`, `contactPhone`, `address`, `category`, `description`, `logoURL`, `adPackageTier`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

- **Advertisement**: `adID (PK)`, `businessID (FK)`, `campaignName`, `adCreativeURL`, `adCopy`, `status (Active/Paused)`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `impressions`, `clicks`, `conversions`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

- **ServiceListing (Resident-to-Resident)**: `listingID (PK)`, `posterUserID (FK)`, `type (Offer/Request)`, `category (Skill/Tool/Service)`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `status (Available/Fulfilled)`, `exchangeMechanism (e.g., TimeBank Credits)`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

- **CheckinRequest**: `checkinID (PK)`, `requesterUserID (FK)`, `targetUserID (FK)`, `status (Pending/Completed/Cancelled)`, `scheduledTime`, `notes`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

- **Neighborhood**: `neighborhoodID (PK)`, `name`, `zipCode`, `city`, `state`, `description`, `isActive`

- **NewsletterIssue**: `issueID (PK)`, `neighborhoodID (FK)`, `issueDate`, `contentHTML`, `status (Draft/Published)`, `createdByUserID (FK)`, `deploymentMetrics`

- **InternalTeamUser**: `internalUserID (PK)`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `role (Admin/Manager/Agent)`, `firstName`, `lastName`

## 5. Security Considerations

- **Least Privilege**: All components and users will operate with the minimum necessary permissions.

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest (database, backups) and in transit (SSL/TLS for all communication).

- **Input Validation**: Strict validation on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS).

- **API Security**: Rate limiting, API key management, and robust error handling.

- **Regular Audits**: Scheduled security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning.

- **Privacy by Design**: Personal data handling will comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations from the ground up.

## 6. Scalability Plan

- **Microservices (Future)**: The current monolithic application design can evolve into a microservices architecture for specific domains (e.g., `Auth Service`, `Ad Management Service`, `Exchange Service`) as complexity and load increase.

- **Stateless Services**: Backend services will be designed to be stateless to facilitate horizontal scaling.

- **Database Scaling**: PostgreSQL can be scaled vertically (larger instance) initially, with options for read replicas, sharding, or cloud-managed solutions (e.g., AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL) for future horizontal scaling.

- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: For faster delivery of static assets (images, videos, CSS, JS) to users globally.

- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of backend services.

## 7. Deployment Architecture

- **Development**: Local development environments using Docker Compose.

- **Staging**: A replica of the production environment for testing new features and releases.

- **Production**: Containerized applications deployed to Kubernetes or ECS, managed by CI/CD pipelines. Automated rollbacks will be configured for failed deployments.
