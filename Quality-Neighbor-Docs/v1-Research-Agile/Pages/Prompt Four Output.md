# Prompt Four Output

Here is the comprehensive Visual Style Guide for **Quality Neighbor**, created to bring those attributes to life on the landing page. This guide is designed to be directly implemented by a designer or used within a no-code landing page builder.

### **Visual Style Guide: Quality Neighbor**

This guide translates the brand attributes—Friendly, Modern, Clean, Trustworthy, and Warm—into a cohesive visual system optimized for readability and conversion.

---

### **1. Color Palette**

The palette is designed to feel trustworthy and warm, with a clear, friendly accent for calls to action.

- **Primary Color (Trustworthy & Stable):**

    - **Deep Navy Blue:** `#1A2D4D`

    - *Usage:* Main headlines, dark backgrounds for trust-building sections (like the final CTA), and footer.

- **Secondary Color (Warm & Clean):**

    - **Soft Off-White:** `#F9F7F3`

    - *Usage:* The main background color for the page. It's warmer and more approachable than stark white, reducing eye strain.

- **Accent Color / CTA (Friendly & Action-Oriented):**

    - **Vibrant Community Green:** `#38A869`

    - *Usage:* Exclusively for all call-to-action buttons (e.g., `Get My Free Newsletter`) and clickable links to train the user's eye.

- **Supporting Colors:**

    - **Body Text:** `#333333` (A dark gray, softer than pure black).

    - **Borders & Dividers:** `#EAEAEA` (A light gray for subtle separation).

### **2. Typography**

The font pairing balances a modern, friendly feel for headlines with maximum readability for body text.

- **Headings (H1, H2, H3):**

    - **Font:** **Poppins**

    - **Weight:** Semi-Bold (600)

    - **Style:** Modern, rounded, and friendly. It's perfect for creating an approachable yet clean look.

    - *Example:* `Rediscover Hartland Ranch.`

- **Body Text:**

    - **Font:** **Inter**

    - **Weight:** Regular (400)

    - **Style:** A highly readable and clean sans-serif that works exceptionally well for both paragraphs and UI elements.

    - *Example:* `Get a free, monthly email that’s actually about your community—not arguments.`

### **3. Button Styles**

Buttons are designed to be obvious, tappable, and inviting.

- **Primary CTA Button:**

    - **Background Color:** Vibrant Community Green (`#38A869`)

    - **Text Color:** White (`#FFFFFF`)

    - **Font:** Inter, Bold

    - **Style:** Rounded corners (e.g., 8px border-radius) to feel friendly. A very subtle drop shadow to make it "pop" off the page.

    - **Size:** Large and easy to tap, spanning the full width on mobile devices.

- **Hover State:**

    - **Effect:** On mouse-over, the button should lighten slightly (e.g., to `#3FCC7A`) and lift with a more pronounced shadow, providing clear visual feedback that it's clickable.

### **4. Whitespace and Spacing**

A "clean and modern" aesthetic is achieved through the generous and consistent use of whitespace.

- **Principle:** Don't crowd elements. Whitespace improves focus and readability.

- **Grid System:** Use an 8px grid system for consistency. All spacing (margins, padding) should be a multiple of 8 (e.g., 16px, 24px, 32px, 64px).

- **Section Spacing:** Use significant vertical space (e.g., 80px-120px) between each major section of the landing page (Hero, Problem, Solution, etc.) to create a clear visual rhythm.

### **5. Image and Icon Guidance**

Visuals must be authentic to build trust and reflect the community.

- **Imagery:**

    - **Style:** AVOID generic stock photos at all costs. Use high-quality, authentic photographs of the actual Hartland Ranch community, its people, and its local businesses.

    - **Tone:** Images should feel warm, candid, and positive. Lots of natural light and genuine smiles.

- **Icons:**

    - **Style:** Use a single, consistent icon set. A clean, "outlined" style with rounded corners is recommended to match the friendly aesthetic.

    - **Example:** For the "How It Works" section, use simple, universally understood icons (envelope, calendar, heart).

### **6. Mobile Optimization Principles**

The design must prioritize the mobile experience.

- **Layout:** A strict single-column layout is essential for a simple, linear scrolling experience.

- **Font Size:** Ensure body text is at a minimum of 16px to be easily readable on mobile screens.

- **Tap Targets:** Buttons and links must be large enough to be easily tapped with a thumb (minimum 44x44px target area).

### **7. Layout and Grid System**

- **Main Content:** The core content of the landing page should be contained within a central grid (e.g., max-width of 1140px on desktop) to ensure it's easy to read and doesn't stretch to the full screen width.

- **Hero Section:** The hero background image/video can extend to the full browser width, but the text content should remain within the central grid.
