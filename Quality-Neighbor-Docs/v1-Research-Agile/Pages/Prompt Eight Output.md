# Prompt Eight Output

Of course. This is the exciting part where our strategy, copy, and visual style all come together.

Using `07_Hubspot_Landing_Prompt_Seven`, I will now generate a complete and detailed mockup template. This description combines the **Final Landing Page Structure (V3)** with the **Visual Style Guide** we created. It's comprehensive enough that a designer could build the page exactly as described.

---

### **Quality Neighbor: Landing Page Mockup Template**

- **General Notes:**

    - **Background Color:** Soft Off-White (`#F9F7F3`).

    - **Main Content Width:** All text and content elements are centered within a 1140px maximum-width container on desktop, switching to a single, screen-spanning column on mobile.

    - **Spacing Unit:** A base unit of 8px is used for all spacing and padding.

---

### **1. Hero Section**

- **Visual Layout:** The background video extends to the full browser width. All text content is left-aligned within the central container for a clean, modern look. There is ample padding at the top and bottom (e.g., 96px) to give it space to breathe.

- **Text Content & Formatting:**

    - **Headline (H1):** `Rediscover Hartland Ranch. (Without the Noise).`

        - *Style:* Poppins font, Semi-Bold (600), ~52px size, Deep Navy Blue (`#1A2D4D`).

        - *Style:* Inter font, Regular (400), ~20px size, Dark Gray (`#333333`). Spacing of ~24px below the headline.

    - **Key Benefit Bullets:** Three bullet points arranged horizontally (on desktop) below the sub-headline with ~32px of spacing.

        - *Style:* Inter font, Regular (400), ~16px size, Dark Gray (`#333333`).

        - **Bullet 1:** (Icon: Green checkmark) `100% Hartland Ranch, 0% Drama.`

        - **Bullet 2:** (Icon: Green clock) `The best local news in a 5-minute read.`

        - **Bullet 3:** (Icon: Green sparkle) `Discover hidden gems and support local.`

- **Images & Icons:**

    - **Background:** A high-quality, silent, auto-looping video montage of authentic, positive Hartland Ranch scenes. The video has a subtle dark overlay to ensure text is perfectly readable.

    - **Icons:** Clean, outlined icons in Vibrant Community Green (`#38A869`) next to each benefit bullet.

    - **Primary CTA:** Positioned ~32px below the benefit bullets.

---

### **8. Footer**

- **Text Content & Formatting:**

    - `© 2025 Quality Neighbor | Privacy Policy | Terms of Service`

    - *Style:* Inter, Regular, ~14px, a lighter shade of gray/white so it's readable but not prominent. The "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service" are active links.
