# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We regularly maintain and patch the latest stable version of this repository. Older versions may not receive security updates unless otherwise noted.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not create a public issue.**
2. Email us at [antonio.reid@aigency.site] with details of the vulnerability.
3. Include as much information as possible so we can resolve the issue quickly, such as:
    - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
    - Impact assessment (how it can be exploited, potential damage)
    - Suggested fix (optional)

We aim to respond to security reports within 5 business days. Once the issue is confirmed, we will work with you to coordinate disclosure and patching.

## Security Updates

Security fixes will be released as soon as possible and will be included in the release notes.

## Best Practices

- Keep your dependencies up to date.
- Do not share sensitive information (such as credentials or API keys) in issues or pull requests.
- Report security concerns privately as described above.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask researchers to act in good faith and avoid exploiting vulnerabilities for any reason other than testing, and to give us reasonable time to address issues before public disclosure.
